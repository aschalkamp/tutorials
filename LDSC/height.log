Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
MAF:	Allele frequency
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)
